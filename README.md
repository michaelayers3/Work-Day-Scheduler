# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This repo contains a work day scheduler. The work day scheduler has a time block for each business hour, with each time block being color coded whether time block is in the past, the present, or the future. The scheduler has a text area where the user can enter an event. The user can save the event to local storage. The scheduler also displays the current date and time at the top of the page.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The work day scheduler can be used to plan events within one's day. The color coded helps the user see whether the events have passed, are present, or have yet to occur. This planner is helpful with the use of local storage such that the information doesn't disappear when the page is refreshed.
